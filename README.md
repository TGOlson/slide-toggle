# Slide Toggle Buttons

An open source library of flat UI slide toggle buttons.

### Why

Nice looking toggle buttons take an unproportional amount time to make compared to other HTML elements. Some larger libraries and frameworks exist that include toggle buttons, but not in a way that makes it easy to just use as a one-off feature.

### What

That's why I've created this open source library of toggle buttons. This library lets you quickly and simply add a toggle button feature to any website, and aims to make customization just as easy.

### How

Either include [this external link](#) to the button.js and button.css files in your page, or download the files and use them locally.

Then simply add the correct div classes to your code, for example: 

```html
<div class='toggle-button toggled'>
	<div class='toggle-circle border'></div>
</div>	
```

This slide toggle library runs on vanilla Javascript with a non-browser specific implementation, so it is extremely light weight, with no need to worry about additional external libraries.
